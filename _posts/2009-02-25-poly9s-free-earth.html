title: Poly9's free earth
---

<p>
So to introduce the new blog I thought I would also introduce a new idea.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://poly9.com/" target="_blank">Poly9</a> has a rad piece of software called <a href="http://freeearth.poly9.com/" target="_blank">free earth</a>
which according to their site is a <span class="site_quote">"cross-browser, cross-platform 3D globe which does not require any download."</span>
</p>

<p>
I thought it would be a nifty if eschaton could provide an abstraction for rails developers to add a 3D world globe to their sites, so 
in the next few weeks I'm going to begin this. The eschaton code would look much the same as the google maps api. 
</p>

<p>
Watch this space for <span class="site_quote">FreeEarth::Map</span> to appear.
</p>
