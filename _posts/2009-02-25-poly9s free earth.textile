title: Poly9's free earth
---

So to introduce the new blog I thought I would also introduce a new idea.

<a href="http://poly9.com/" target="_blank">Poly9</a> has a rad piece of software called <a href="http://freeearth.poly9.com/" target="_blank">free earth</a>
which according to their site is a <span class="site_quote">"cross-browser, cross-platform 3D globe which does not require any download."</span>

I thought it would be a nifty if eschaton could provide an abstraction for rails developers to add 3D maps to their sites, so 
in the next few weeks I'm going to begin this. The eschaton code would look much the same as the google maps api. 

Watch this space for <span class="site_quote">FreeEarth::Map</span> to appear.
